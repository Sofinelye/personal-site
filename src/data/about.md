# Intro

I am currenly an MBA candidate (class of 23') at Fuqua Business School.
I received both my B.S. and M.S degrees from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in Civil Engineering.
<br />
<br />
After graduating from school, I worked as a structural engineer and have worked on aviation designs including PHL, DCA, and JFK in the DMV area. Later in my career, I shifted my focus on building internal automation tools that expediate the structural design process and minimize repetitive tasks. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop their user experience and product strategies.
<br />
<br />
One year before coming to Fuqua, I worked as a research engineer at USC, I performed [researches](http://www.ce.sc.edu/#/yuqian/team) in strategic management of limited transportation recourses to support mobility of disadvantaged and disabled traverlers.
