Yet, tens of thousands of students depend on a reliable way to get them to different classes everywhere, to go grocery shoppings away from campus, and arrive home safely after working up late at libraries. Car pooling might be a good idea for students who share the same destinations to hop on a car and save some time and bucks. That’s where HHitch comes into play. HHitch is an app aimed to help student to navigate through on and off-campus lives. The app has several features to ensure the safety of the students. ',
